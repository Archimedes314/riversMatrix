# riversMatrix
Given a 2D array (matrix) whose height and width are not necessarily equal and which contains only 1's and 0's, where the 1's represent water and 0's represent land. Rivers consist of any number of 1's that are vertically or horizontally adjacent (but not diagonally). The function 'riverSizes' receives such a matrix as input and returns an array containing the sizes of all rivers in the matrix (the sizes of rivers in the output array follows no specific order)
